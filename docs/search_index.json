Magwene 2018-08-27 Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 How to use these lecture notes In this and future materials to be posted on the course website you’ll encounter blocks of R code. Your natural intuition will be to cut and paste commands or code blocks into the R interpretter to save yourself the typing. DO NOT DO THIS!! In each of the examples below, I provide example input, but I don’t show you the output. It’s your job to type in these examples at the R console, evaluate what you typed, and to look at and think critically about the output. You will make mistakes and generate errors! Part of learning any new skill is making mistakes, figuring out where you went wrong, and correcting those mistakes. In the process of fixing those errors, you’ll learn more about how R works, and how to avoid such errors, or correct bugs in your own code in the future. If you cut and paste the examples into the R interpretter the code will run, but you will learn less than if you input the code yourself and you’ll be less capable of apply the concepts in new situations. The R interpretter, like all programming languages, is very exacting. A mispelled variable or function name, a stray period, or an unbalanced parenthesis will raise an error and finding the sources of such errors can sometimes be tedious and frustrating. Persist! If you read your code critically, think about what your doing, and seek help when needed (teaching team, R help, Google, etc) you’ll eventually get better at debugging your code. But keep in mind that like most new skills, learning to write and debug your code efficiently takes time and experience. "],

R is a statistical computing environment and programming language. It is free, open source, and has a large and active community of developers and users. There are many different R packages (libraries) available for conducting out a wide variety of different analyses, for everything from genome sequence data to geospatial information. 2.2 What is RStudio? RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/) is an open source integrated development environment (IDE) that provides a nicer graphical interface to R than does the default R GUI. The figure below illustrates the RStudio interface, in it’s default configuration. For the exercises below you’ll be primarily entering commands in the “console” window. We’ll review key parts of the RStudio interface in greater detail in class. Figure 2.1: RStudio window with the panes labeled 2.3 Entering commands in the console You can type commands directly in the console. When you hit Return (Enter) on your keyboard the text you typed is evaluated by the R interpreter. This means that the R program reads your commands, makes sure there are no syntax errors, and then carries out any commands that were specified. Try evaluating the following arithmetic commands in the console: 10 + 5 [1] 15 10 - 5 [1] 5 10 / 5 [1] 2 10 * 5 [1] 50 If you type an incomplete command and then hit Return on your keyboard, the console will show a continuation line marked by a + symbol. For example enter the incomplete statement (10 + 5 and then hit Enter. You should see something like this. &gt; (10 + 5 + The continuation line tells you that R is waiting for additional input before it evaluates what you typed. Either complete your command (e.g. type the closing parenthesis) and hit Return, or hit the “Esc” key to exit the continuation line without evaluating what you typed. 2.4 Comments When working in the R console, or writing R code, the pound symbol (#) indicates the start of a comment. Anything after the #, up to the end of the current line, is ignored by the R interpretter. # This line will be ignored 5 + 4 # the first part of this line, up to the #, will be evaluated [1] 9 Throughout this course I will often include short explanatory comments in my code examples. 2.5 Using R as a Calculator The simplest way to use R is as a fancy calculator. 10 + 2 # addition 10 - 2 # subtraction 10 * 2 # multiplication 10 / 2 # division 10 ^ 2 # exponentiation 10 ** 2 # alternate exponentiation pi * 2.5^2 # R knows about some constants such as Pi 10 %% 3 # modulus operator -- gives remainder after division 10 %/% 3 # integer division Be aware that certain operators have precedence over others. For example multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction. Use parentheses to disambiguate potentially confusing statements. (10 + 2)/4-5 # was the output what you expected? [1] -2 (10 + 2)/(4-5) # compare the answer to the above [1] -12 Division by zero produces an object that represents infinite numbers. Infinite values can be either positive or negative 1/0 # Inf [1] Inf -1/0 # -Inf [1] -Inf Invalid calculations produce a objected called NaN which is short for “Not a Number”: 0/0 # invalid calculation [1] NaN 2.5.1 Common mathematical functions Many commonly used mathematical functions are built into R. Here are some examples: abs(-3) # absolute value [1] 3 abs(3) [1] 3 cos(pi/3) # cosine [1] 0.5 sin(pi/3) # sine [1] 0.8660254 log(10) # natural logarithm [1] 2.302585 log10(10) # log base 10 [1] 1 log2(10) # log base 2 [1] 3.321928 exp(1) # exponential function [1] 2.718282 sqrt(10) # square root [1] 3.162278 10 ^ 0.5 # same as square root [1] 3.162278 2.6 Numeric data types in R There are three standard types of numbers in R. You can use the function typeof() to get information about an objects type in R. “double” – this is the default numeric data type, and is used to represent both real numbers and whole numbers (unless you explicitly ask for integers, see below). “double” is short for “double precision floating point value”. All of the previous computations you’ve seen up until this point used data of type double. ```r typeof(10.0) # real number [1] &quot;double&quot; typeof(10) # whole numbers default to doubles [1] &quot;double&quot; ``` “integer” – when your numeric data involves only whole numbers, you can get slighly better performance using the integer data type. You must explicitly ask for numbers to be treated as integers. ```r typeof(as.integer(10)) # now treated as an integer [1] &quot;integer&quot; ``` “complex” – R has a built-in data type to represent complex numbers – numbers with a “real” and “imaginary” component. We won’t encounter the use of complex numbers in this course, but they do have many important uses in mathematics and engineering and also have some interesting applications in biology. ```r typeof(1 + 0i) [1] &quot;complex&quot; sqrt(-1) # sqrt of -1, using doubles [1] NaN sqrt(-1 + 0i) # sqrt of -1, using complex numbers [1] 0+1i ``` 2.7 Variable assignment in R An important programming concept in all programming languages is that of “variable assignment”. Variable assignment is the act of creating labels that point to particular data values in a computers memory, which allows us to apply operations to the labels rather than directly to specific. Variable assignment is an important mechanism of abstracting and generalizing computational operations. Variable assignment in R is accomplished with the assignment operator, which is designated as &lt;- (left arrow, constructed from a left angular brack and the minus sign). This is illustrated below: x &lt;- 10 # assign the variable name &#39;x&#39; the value 10 sin(x) # apply the sin function to the value x points to [1] -0.5440211 x &lt;- pi # x now points to a different value sin(x) # the same function call now produces a different result [1] 1.224647e-16 2.7.1 Valid variable names As described in the R documentation, “A syntactically valid name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters and starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number. Names such as ‘.2way’ are not valid, and neither are the reserved words.” Here are some examples of valid and invalid variable names. Mentally evaluate these based on the definition above, and then evaluate these in the R interpetter to confirm your understanding : x &lt;- 10 x.prime &lt;- 10 x_prime &lt;- 10 my.long.variable.name &lt;- 10 another_long_variable_name &lt;- 10 _x &lt;- 10 .x &lt;- 10 2.x &lt;- 2 * x 2.8 Working with Vectors in R Vectors are the core data structure in R. Vectors store an ordered lists of items, all of the same type. Learning to compute effectively with vectors and one of the keys to efficient R programming. Vectors in R always have a type (accessed with the typeof() function) and a length (accessed with the length() function). The simplest way to create a vector at the interactive prompt is to use the c() function, which is short hand for combine' orconcatenate’. x &lt;- c(2,4,6,8) # create a vector, assignn it the variable name `x` length(x) [1] 4 typeof(x) [1] &quot;double&quot; You can also use c() to concatenate two or more vectors together. y &lt;- c(1,3,5,7,9) # create another vector, labeled y xy &lt;- c(x,y) # combine two vectors z &lt;- c(pi/4, pi/2, pi, 2*pi) xyz &lt;- c(x, y, z) # combine three vectors 2.8.1 Vector Arithmetic The basic R arithmetic operations work on vectors as well as on single numbers (in fact single numbers are vectors). x &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10) x * 2 # multiply each element of x by 2 [1] 4 8 12 16 20 x - pi # subtract pi from each element of x [1] -1.1415927 0.8584073 2.8584073 4.8584073 6.8584073 y &lt;- c(0, 1, 3, 5, 9) x + y # add together each matching element of x and y [1] 2 5 9 13 19 x * y # multiply each matching element of x and y [1] 0 4 18 40 90 x/y # divide each matching element of x and y [1] Inf 4.000000 2.000000 1.600000 1.111111 Basic numerical functions operate element-wise on numerical vectors: sin(x) [1] 0.9092974 -0.7568025 -0.2794155 0.9893582 -0.5440211 cos(x * pi) [1] 1 1 1 1 1 log(x) [1] 0.6931472 1.3862944 1.7917595 2.0794415 2.3025851 2.8.2 Vector recycling When vectors are not of the same length R `recycles’ the elements of the shorter vector to make the lengths conform. x &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10) length(x) [1] 5 z &lt;- c(1, 4, 7, 11) length(z) [1] 4 x + z [1] 3 8 13 19 11 In the example above z was treated as if it was the vector (1, 4, 7, 11, 1). 2.8.3 Simple statistical functions for numeric vectors Now that we’ve introduced vectors as the simplest data structure for holding collections of numerical values, we can introduce a few of the most common statistical functions that operate on such vectors. First let’s create a vector to hold our sample data of interest. Here I’ve taken a random sample of the lengths of the last names of students enrolled in Bio 723 during Spring 2018. len.name &lt;- c(7, 7, 6, 2, 9, 9, 7, 4, 10, 5) Some common statistics of interest include minimum, maximum, mean, median, variance, and standard deviation: min(len.name) [1] 2 max(len.name) [1] 10 mean(len.name) [1] 6.6 median(len.name) [1] 7 var(len.name) # variance [1] 6.044444 sd(len.name) # standard deviation [1] 2.458545 The summary() function applied to a vector of doubles produce a useful table of some of these key statistics: summary(len.name) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 2.00 5.25 7.00 6.60 8.50 10.00 2.9 The R Help System R comes with fairly extensive documentation and a simple help system. You can access HTML versions of the R documentation under the Help tab in Rstudio. The HTML documentation also includes information on any packages you’ve installed. Take a few minutes to browse through the R HTML documentation. In addition to the HTML documentation there is also a search box where you can enter a term to search on (see red arrow in figure below). Figure 2.2: The RStudio Help tab 2.9.1 Getting help from the console In addition to getting help from the RStudio help tab, you can directly search for help from the console. The help system can be invoked using the help function or the ? operator. help(&quot;log&quot;) ?log If you are using RStudio, the help results will appear in the “Help” tab of the Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (lower right window by default). What if you don’t know the name of the function you want? You can use the help.search() function. help.search(&quot;log&quot;) In this case help.search(&quot;log&quot;) returns all the functions with the string log in them. For more on help.search type ?help.search. Other useful help related functions include apropos() and example(). apropos returns a list of all objects (including function names) in the current session that match the input string. apropos(&quot;log&quot;) [1] &quot;as.data.frame.logical&quot; &quot;as.logical&quot; [3] &quot;as.logical.factor&quot; &quot;dlogis&quot; [5] &quot;is.logical&quot; &quot;log&quot; [7] &quot;log10&quot; &quot;log1p&quot; [9] &quot;log2&quot; &quot;logb&quot; [11] &quot;Logic&quot; &quot;logical&quot; [13] &quot;logLik&quot; &quot;loglin&quot; [15] &quot;plogis&quot; &quot;qlogis&quot; [17] &quot;rlogis&quot; &quot;SSlogis&quot; example() provides examples of how a function is used. example(log) log&gt; log(exp(3)) [1] 3 log&gt; log10(1e7) # = 7 [1] 7 log&gt; x &lt;- 10^-(1+2*1:9) log&gt; cbind(x, log(1+x), log1p(x), exp(x)-1, expm1(x)) x [1,] 1e-03 9.995003e-04 9.995003e-04 1.000500e-03 1.000500e-03 [2,] 1e-05 9.999950e-06 9.999950e-06 1.000005e-05 1.000005e-05 [3,] 1e-07 1.000000e-07 1.000000e-07 1.000000e-07 1.000000e-07 [4,] 1e-09 1.000000e-09 1.000000e-09 1.000000e-09 1.000000e-09 [5,] 1e-11 1.000000e-11 1.000000e-11 1.000000e-11 1.000000e-11 [6,] 1e-13 9.992007e-14 1.000000e-13 9.992007e-14 1.000000e-13 [7,] 1e-15 1.110223e-15 1.000000e-15 1.110223e-15 1.000000e-15 [8,] 1e-17 0.000000e+00 1.000000e-17 0.000000e+00 1.000000e-17 [9,] 1e-19 0.000000e+00 1.000000e-19 0.000000e+00 1.000000e-19 2.10 Packages Packages are libraries of R functions and data that provide additional capabilities and tools beyond the standard library of functions included with R. Hundreds of people around the world have developed packages for R that provide functions and related data structures for conducting many different types of analyses. Throughout this course you’ll need to install a variety of packages. Here I show the basic procedure for installing new packages from the console as well as from the R Studio interface. 2.10.1 Installing packages from the console The built-in function install.packages provides a quick and conveniet way to install packages from the R console. 2.10.2 Install the tidyverse package To illustrate the use of install.package, we’ll install a collection of packages (a “meta-package”) called the tidyverse. Here’s how to install the tidyverse meta-package from the R console: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;, dependencies = TRUE) The first argument to install.packages gives the names of the package we want to install. The second argument, dependencies = TRUE, tells R to install any additional packages that tidyverse depends on. 2.10.3 Installing packages from the RStudio dialog You can also install packages using a graphical dialog provided by RStudio. To do so pick the Packages tab in RStudio, and then click the Install button. Figure 2.3: The Packages tab in RStudio In the packages entry box you can type the name of the package you wish to install. 2.10.4 Install the stringr package Let’s install another useful package called “stringr”. Type the package name in the “Packages” field, make sure the “Install dependencies” check box is checked, and then press the “Install” button. Figure 2.4: Package Install Dialog 2.10.5 Loading packages with the library() function Once a package is installed on your computer, the package can be loaded into your R session using the library function. To insure our previous install commands worked correctly, let’s load the packages we just installed. library(stringr) library(tidyverse) Since the tidyverse pacakge is a “meta-package” it provides some additional info about the sub-packages that got loaded. When you load tidyverse, you will also see a message about “Conflicts” as several of the functions provided in the dplyr package (a sub-package in tidyverse) conflict with names of functions provided by the “stats” package which usually gets automically loaded when you start R. The conflicting funcdtions are filter and lag. The conflicting functions in the stats package are lag and filter which are used in time series analysis. The dplyr functions are more generally useful. Furthermore, if you need these masked functions you can still access them by prefacing the function name with the name of the package (e.g. stats::filter). "]
